# myname = "Madhav" # flat case
# my_name = "Madhav" # snake case

# Rules to declare a vriables
# 1. variable name must be start with: letter or _ ( a or _a )
_my_name = "Madhav"
print(_my_name)

# 2. variable name can contain: letter, numbers, underscore_ don't use any special symbol like $, @,and so on.
my_name1 = "Chanchal"
